In the Git section of this course, the tutorial about Tags In Git highlighted the importance of Tags in the Git world. They are vital when we need to show the releases and tag-specific commits. Their frequent use in Git has made them quite popular. But, this tutorial does not talk about Git. Tags are much more than tagging the commits as we did in Git.
